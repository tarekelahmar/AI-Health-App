## Sleep Quality Restoration Protocol

### Assessment
- Normal: Sleep 7–9 hours, feel rested
- Mild: 6–7 hours, some daytime fatigue
- Severe: <6 hours, significant impairment

### Root Causes
1. **Circadian Misalignment** – lights, schedule
2. **Inadequate Magnesium** – cofactor for sleep
3. **Elevated Cortisol** – stress/caffeine

### Interventions (Evidence-Based)
- **Sleep Hygiene**: Dark room, cool temperature (65–68°F), no screens 1 hour before bed
- **Magnesium**: 200–400 mg glycinate form, taken 1–2 hours before sleep
- **Meditation**: 10 minutes before bed (moderate evidence)
- **Caffeine Cutoff**: No caffeine after 2 PM

### Monitoring
- Track sleep duration daily via wearable
- Reassess in 2 weeks
- Adjust if still <7 hours

## Blood Sugar Regulation Protocol

### Assessment
- Normal: Fasting glucose 70–100 mg/dL
- Pre-diabetes: 100–125 mg/dL
- Diabetes: >126 mg/dL

### Root Causes
1. **High Refined Carbohydrate Intake**
2. **Insulin Resistance** – poor diet, sedentary
3. **Insufficient Fiber**

### Interventions
- **Dietary**: Whole grains, vegetables, moderate protein with each meal
- **Chromium**: 200 mcg daily (enhances insulin sensitivity)
- **Movement**: 30-min walk after meals (lowers post-meal glucose spike)
- **Sleep**: Improve sleep (see Sleep Protocol) – impacts glucose regulation

## HRV (Heart Rate Variability) Optimization

### Assessment
- Normal: 50–100 ms
- Mild Stress: 30–50 ms
- Severe Stress: <30 ms

### Root Causes
1. **Chronic Stress** – cortisol elevation
2. **Poor Sleep Quality**
3. **Overtraining** – insufficient recovery
4. **Inflammation** – poor diet, lack of omega-3s

### Interventions
- **Stress Management**: 10 min daily breathing (4-7-8 technique) or meditation
- **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: 2g daily (fish oil or algae)
- **Sleep**: Essential – implement Sleep Protocol first
- **Reduce High-Intensity Exercise**: Switch to zone 2 cardio + strength 3x/week
